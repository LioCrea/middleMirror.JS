# middleMirror.JS
Get the mirror of a slider's middle element in real-time.

No canvas, pur JS script: create the perfect image of whatever is in the middle of a slider

#
# testMiddleMirror.html
This file is just an example.
You can use this script through SQL calls and display the slider through an AJAX success (via JSON or other)

#testMiddleMirror.css
This file is also an example.
Feel free to do what you want with.

#Setup
1. Download the .zip
2. Save middleMirror.js on your targeted folder

# Under progress
Will soon provide a full-working solution for back-end stored images.
